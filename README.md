# bachelor_disaster_rescue
During a disaster, victims are left to themselves until rescue teams arrive. These first hours or days are vital and can save lives if those affected had a way to communicate efficiently. Mobile phones are an option; unfortunately, in many cases, the network infrastructure is also destroyed, making these devices useless. 

This is why this application was developed. It uses Google Nearby to allow offline peer-to-peer communications.
