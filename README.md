# Floater - Ad Hoc disaster communication

![play_store_banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18733561/43368438-40462a10-935d-11e8-9bd8-31051be13876.png)

## Description
During a disaster, victims are left to themselves until rescue teams arrive. These first hours or days are vital and can save lives if those affected had a way to communicate efficiently. Mobile phones are an option; unfortunately, in many cases, the network infrastructure is also destroyed, making these devices useless. 

This is why this application was developed. It uses Google Nearby to allow offline peer-to-peer communications.
